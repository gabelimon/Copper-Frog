# Copper Frog

Copper Frog is a SaaS provisioning system. It (very simply put) will take webhooks from recurring
billing systems such as KillBill, Recurly, QBO, and even SFDC. Building these integrations will take
time but it should be simple. Once you've mapped your package properties, CF will relay messages to internal
systems for actions like provisioning accounts, updating license restrictions (eg. head count), and
cleaning clients that are no longer with you.
